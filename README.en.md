# carton

`carton` is a desktop client powered by `sing-box`. The project aims to stay as close as possible to the official SFM experience in interaction flow and information layout, while focusing on high performance and a few practical extra features.

The project is still in an early stage, but its direction is already clear:

- Keep the experience close to official SFM to reduce migration cost
- Prioritize performance, responsiveness, and startup speed
- Add useful features without breaking the main workflow

> `carton` is not an official SFM client and is not affiliated with the sing-box team.

## Highlights

### Familiar workflow close to official SFM

- Six core pages: Dashboard, Groups, Profiles, Connections, Logs, and Settings
- Common actions such as start, stop, status check, and group switching are kept in the main workflow
- Built-in Clash API / WebUI entry to match existing usage habits

### Performance-oriented

- Built with `Avalonia` and `.NET 10`
- Includes `NativeAOT` publish scripts for faster startup and lower runtime overhead
- Uses on-demand page loading and background page release/refresh control to reduce long-running resource usage

### Config and subscription management

- Create, import, and edit local configs
- Import remote subscriptions with manual update and auto-update intervals
- Save per-profile runtime options before startup

### Node and group enhancements

- Read and display outbound groups
- Support node switching, latency testing, and URLTest refresh
- View and switch groups directly from the tray menu
- Optionally disconnect affected connections after node switching

### Practical extras

- System proxy toggle
- Runtime options for TUN, listen port, LAN access, and log level
- Real-time traffic, memory usage, session duration, connections, and logs
- sing-box kernel download, update, and custom kernel installation
- App update channels, backup export/import, and portable data directory switching
- Chinese and English UI with theme settings

## Tech Stack

- `Avalonia UI`
- `.NET 10`
- `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm`
- `sing-box`
- `Velopack`

## Development and Build

### Requirements

- `.NET 10 SDK`

### Local build

```powershell
dotnet build carton.slnx
```

### Windows NativeAOT publish

```powershell
scripts\publish-win-aot.bat win-x64 Release
```

Or use the packaging script that also creates the installer:

```powershell
scripts\build-release-win-x64.bat
```

The repository already contains multiple runtime targets, while the current ready-to-use release scripts are mainly organized around the Windows build flow.

## Positioning

If you want:

- an experience that stays close to official SFM
- stronger focus on performance
- a few practical features beyond the official client

then `carton` is being built in exactly that direction.
